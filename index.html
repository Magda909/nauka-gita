       <h1>Dance Monkey</h1> 
       <p>They say, "Oh my God, I see the way you shine"
        Take your hands, my dear, and place them both in mine
        You know you stopped me dead while I was passing by
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time</p>

        <p>Ohhh I, see you, see you, seen you every time
        And oh my I, I like you style
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time</p>

        <p>So they say
        Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me, oh oh oh
        I’ve never seen anybody do the things you do before
        They say
        Move for me, move for me, move for me, ay ay ay
        And when you’re done, I'll make you do it all again</p>

        <p>I said, "Oh my God, I see you walking by"
        Take my hands, my dear, and look me in my eyes
        Just like a monkey, I’ve been dancing my whole life
        But you just beg to see me dance just one more time</p>

        <p>Ooh I, see you, see you, seen you every time
        And oh my I, I like your style
        You, you make me, make me, make me wanna cry
        And now I beg to see you dance just one more time
        </p>
